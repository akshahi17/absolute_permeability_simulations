# Permeability Simulation Using PoreSpy and OpenPNM

This repository hosts a Jupyter Notebook to perform network-based simulation of permeability using X-ray microtomography images as input. 

**Suitable X-ray microtomography images for input can be found [here](https://www.digitalrocksportal.org/projects/317).**

**The network extraction step leverages the [PoreSpy](http://porespy.org/) package.**

**The fluid simulation step leverages the [OpenPNM](http://openpnm.org/) package.**
