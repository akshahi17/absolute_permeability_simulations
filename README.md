# Permeability Simulation Using PoreSpy and OpenPNM

This repository hosts a Jupyter Notebook to perform network-based simulation of permeability using X-ray microtomography images as input. 
The network extraction step is performed using the [PoreSpy](http://porespy.org/) package. 
The fluid simulation step is performed using the [OpenPNM](http://openpnm.org/) package.

Suitable X-ray microtomography images for input can be found [here](https://www.digitalrocksportal.org/projects/317).
